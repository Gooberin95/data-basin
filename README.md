testing out python connection to azure sql database
## Dealing with git issues is annoying and alot of work

# I am switching to using sqlalchemy because pandas prefers sqlalchemy instead of pyodbc

## pyodbc requires manual handling of connections which can lead to memory leaks

### pyodbc is mainly for sql server

# SQL Alchemy allows for ORM and raw SQL queries
# PYODBC is mostly a low-level database connector, which requires manual sql execution
